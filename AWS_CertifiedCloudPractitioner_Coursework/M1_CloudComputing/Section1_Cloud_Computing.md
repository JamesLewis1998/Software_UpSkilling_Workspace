# AWS Cloud Computing Module One ##

**Cloud Computing**
> Is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go priority

 - Implies AWS has those resources available as and when you need them
 - Many businesses need the same types of resource. E.g My SQL DB
    - AWS does the undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT

## Deployment Models of Cloud Computing ##

1. Required Cloud Application Components
2. Preferenced Resource Management Tools 
3. Legacy IT Infrastructure Requirements

_All factors a company must consider when selecting Cloud Strategy_ 

## Cloud-Based Deployment ##
1. Run all parts of the application in the cloud
2. Migrate existing applications to the cloud
3. Design and Build new applications in the cloud

_Company might create application consisting of virtual servcers, databases and NW'ing components that are fully based in the could_

Important to consider Low Level vs High Level Cloud Infrastructure

## On-Premise Deployment ##
1. Deploying resources by using virtualisation and resource management tools
2. Increase resource utlilisation by using Application management and virtualisation technologies

_On premise deployment aka prviate cloud deployment means resources are deployed on premises by virtualisation and resource management tools_

_Note, addition of virtualisation technology and cloud management is AWS's contribution to the companies on premise data centres_

## Hybrid Deployment ##
1. Connected cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure 
2. Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT Applications

_Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure_

This approach makes sense when you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises

### Benefits of Cloud Computing ###

- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
    - upfront expense being physical servers and other resources requiring investment before set up
    - Variable means only pay for computing resource you consume instead of investing heavily in data centres and servers before you know you're going to use them
