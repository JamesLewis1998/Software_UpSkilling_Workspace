# AWS Computing in the Cloud Module Two #
**EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud

**EC2** is:
1. Highly Flexible
2. Cost Effective 
3. Quick

**Hardware vs AWS**

_HARDWARE_
> Hardware for server set up: Costs Money and is time consuming to set up -> need servers to host your applications and provide the required compute capacity + a lot of time and effort to set up

_AWS_
> AWS has already built the data centres andcsecured the data centres in conjunction with already provisioning and installing the servers 

**EC2**

EC2 instances can be requested to be launched within minutes and Amazon only charges you for running instances, not stopped or terminated ones

**Multi-Tenancy and Hypervisor**

_Multi-tenancy_ is shared underlying HW between virtual modules 

- Hypervisor is responsble for coordinating this multitenancy and is solely managed by AWS 
- Isolating VMs from each other is done as they share resources from the host meaning EC2 instances are secure
