# ========= Configuring ignored files for a single repository ============

# You can create a . gitignore file in your repository's root directory to tell 
# Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit.

# To ignore specific files ending in .pyc
*.pyc

# To ignore an entire directory with all its contents, you need to 
# include the name of the directory with the slash / at the end:

.vscode/
.venv/ 
.pytest_cache/
