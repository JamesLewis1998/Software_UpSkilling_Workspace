## ======= Loops Overview =========
    # Essential Part of programming, in pyhton we have 
        # While Loops 
        # For Loops

# While Loop Example

# condition = True                    # Condition defined as True
# while condition == True:            # While Condition is True the following is evaluated
#     print ("The Condition is True") # When this is executed the body of the function will run indefinitely in the command window
                                    # Do not run this as the function will infinitely print this into the command window

# To Fix this from happening on the command line, define the following:

condition1 = True
while condition1 == True:           # Whilst Condition1 is True the following statement is printed
    print("The condition1 is True")
    condition1 = False              # Now the Loop runs once - in this case first iteration is run as condition1 is evaluated as true
                                    # Then following this in the body of the Loop the condition1 is then evaluated to False and the condition1 is 
                                    # Then evaluated as False and control goes to the next instruction in the loop - for which there isn't one in this case

# It's common to add an iteration to stop the Loop after some number of cycles
    # For Example here's a While Loop with a Counter: 

count = 0                           # Count starts at 0 
while count < 10:                   # Whilst count is below 10, execute the following
    print("The condition is True")  # Print in the command window
    count = count + 1               # Increments the counter every time until we get to the end
                                    # count outside is initialisation value almost -> count begins at 0
                                    # count internal to while function then runs through 1-10 internal to function
                                    # Until count == 10 then the while Loop is exited and we move to:
print ("After the Loop")            # After count == 10 then code moves to this print condition and prints "After Loop in Cmd window"
