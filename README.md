Even though Python is an interpreted programming language, its interpreter doesn’t operate directly on your Python code, which would be very slow. Instead, when you run a Python script or import a Python module, the interpreter compiles your high-level Python source code into bytecode, which is an intermediate binary representation of the code.

This bytecode enables the interpreter to skip recurring steps, such as lexing and parsing the code into an abstract syntax tree and validating its correctness every time you run the same program. As long as the underlying source code hasn’t changed, Python can reuse the intermediate representation, which is immediately ready for execution. This saves time, speeding up your script’s startup time.

Remember that while loading the compiled bytecode from __pycache__ makes Python modules import faster, it doesn’t affect their execution speed!
