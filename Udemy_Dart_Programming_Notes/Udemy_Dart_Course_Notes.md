## Module Two Notes 

Note on different data types:

**Double vs Float**

1. Short for “floating point value” a float is simply a decimal number
    - 7 digits precision
    - 4 bytes
2. A double is short for “double precision floating point value” and stores numbers twice the length of a float and therefore also takes up twice the memory of a float
    - 15 digits precision
    - 8 bytes
